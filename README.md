# Full stack fest 2017

## Day one

### Keynotes - Science - Backup the internet
Rating: :star: :star: :star: :star:

Karissa McKelvey discussed the topic to share fairly large data sets in the science community in a secure and distributed way. The [dat project](https://docs.datproject.org/) enables file sharing via peer to peer for example with the beaker browser.

### Ehtereum

Luca Marchesini ([@kuzzleio](https://twitter.com/kuzzleio)) did a great job by explanining about blockchain and the differences between ethereum and bitcoin.

### Terraform
Rating: :star: :star:

We love the Terraform frawork of HashiCorp but the talk not as good as we hopped, nothing new. The speaker Anton ([@antonbabenko](https://twitter.com/antonbabenko)) is an expert and topic an also maintains some great [Terraform modules](https://github.com/terraform-community-modules).

### Migrating an existing service to serverless
Rating: :star: :star:

For us a standard talk by Marcia ([@mavi888uy](https://twitter.com/mavi888uy))about migrating an existing monolitic applicaton to smaller components. We loved all the (angry) birds flying around.

### Defending the human network
Rating: :star: :star: :star: :star:

Good story about cyber security. About how the mood of a user is one of the weakest link.
How you can trick people into clicking a bad links. Socially engineering.
Gebruik de zwaktes van een gebruiker.

- Think from the point of view of a hacker.
- Explain people what the conquenses are instead of tell them something to prevent. (inenting)


### Rise and the fall of the full stack database
Rating: :star: :star: :star: :star:

Comparison with the army knife. Don't be afraid of new technologies.
One tool for everything is not going to work.
Example with analytics service, kafka stream, bus.

### How booking.com serves deep learning model predictions
Rating: :star: :star: :star:

Good explaination about how to train a model and how to deploy them.

### What to do when complex systems fail
Rating: 0

Indian overhead talk about incident management with IC, SME, and so on.

## Day Two:

### ioT: An army of devices ready for DDoS
Rating: :star: :star: :star: :star:

Good explaination about how IoT device can be used to do a DDoS attack. About port 1900 showing all kinds of information which is sent to victims address. How to block DDoS attacks by putting the ip-address in a grid to search for patterns. About Trump attacks and about anonymous being stupid by setting the evil flag (We're anonymous)

### How to properly blame things for causing latency. Tracing Zipkin
Rating: :star: :star:

Difference between logs, metric and trace. Good (known) story. We should do some things here.

### Ship more, sink less. Changing chaos engineering & Distributed tracing
Rating: :star: :star:

Nothing new, four year old story. About Chaos Monkey. Chaos GameDay is nice to do once.

### Flying Spaghetti monster: Verifying protocols - idris
Rating: :star: :star: :star: :star:

Complexity of systems cause a lot of problems. Idris has a nice feature that Types are also values, so state changes can easialy be checked in compile time.

Inspiration for doing more with new languages.

### Smart grid: How iot fights climate change
Rating: :star:

Wrong place. Did not know that the power grid has so much complexity.

### Beyond patterns: Technological systems and the nature of order
Rating: :star: :star: :star:

Good to see the that our hipster ship is the same as the problems the manufacturing has already solved.

### Lighting Talks
Rating: :star: :star:

- Docker talk about `docker build` was fun.
- Fullstack is a zoo. Complexity of our work environment.
- Execism: Nice code kata kind of thing.

### Gone in 60 milliseconds: Offensive security in the serverless age
Rating: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:

Awesome DDoS attack of slides. A lot of cool stuff. Serverless python with http://zappa.io
