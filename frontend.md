Jenn Schiffer ([@jennschiffer](https://twitter.com/jennschiffer)) showed how to make coding actually friendly with @glitch. And remember once you got bored you will not trying new cool stuff which makes you even unhappier and so on... And some cool [pixel art](http://jennmoney.biz/)

Service Workers by Houssein Djireden ([@hdjirdeh](https://twitter.com/hdjirdeh)) are stable and most serious browsers support them. SWs are a big help in improving the experience for the user. `Workbox-cli` is a great for configuring your app to cache usefull stuff only. Don't cache too much. `FoamTree` and `webpack-bundle-analytics` show a good overview what to cache. Split up your js, with http/2, we do not need one big js file. React has good SW support.

### Houdini css

Absolutely awesome to see the future already working in this talk by Sam Richard ([@Snugug](https://twitter.com/Snugug)). A lot of visual stuff is currently blocking the main JS thread. With Houdini CSS a lot of css stuff can be handle on Process Workers. 'Much like Service Workers are a low-level JavaScript API for the browser's cache Houdini introduces low-level JavaScript APIs for the browser's render engine'.
Currently only available in Chrome Canary and the definition of unstable, but ooooh so beautiful.

### AST

To understand most JS libraries you only need to know two things. AST and the visitor pattern. With this knowledge you can easily add ESLint, create Babel plugins or add jscodeshift refactor modules.
A great tool to help with AST is https://astexplorer.net

### SVG

Awesome what you can do with SVG. This girl really knows her stuff. SVG is supported by all browsers including Opera Mini! Good integration with VueJS, react and other modern frameworks is possible. Lots of examples of really beautiful animations all working for all types of devices. Size does matter for images and animations. Normally it will result in ugly things, but with SVG this is absolutely not the case.

### Using react native + clojurescript to launch ios/android apps to 1m users
Rating: :star: :star:

A long intro to `react native`, which is most likely not necessary on this conference. A nice twist with `closureScript`. The code looks very clean. It is possible to create apps for both iOS and Android with a 99% simular codebase. The crashlogs of apps created with closurescript and reactnative are unfortunately almost not readible. This set of tools is also great to use in combination with `codepush`. Now we can update the app on the fly without bothering appstores.

### Mars
Rating: :star: :star: :star: :star:

A good talk on how all the new technologies can help us in the future when live is possible on Mars.
Using: `HTTP/2`, `ServiceWorkers`, `LocalStorage`, `Bittorent + git`, `IPFS`, `blockchain`, `bitcoin`, `ethereum`.
"Tomorrow's problems === Today's problems but bigger."
Last year a simular talk was told on FSF, but it's good to see that the technologies mentioned then are now in a much further state. Great talk and good choice from the organiser of this beautiful conference.

### WebGL
Rating: :star:

Simular story as SVG, but limited to `React` and `WebGL`. The power of React's state management is again shown.
